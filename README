Here is the recipe to use these scripts:
First ensure you have these installed on your host:
vim bison patch gawk dialog subversion xml2 xsltproc libxml2-utils and tidy
You can also change the dialog menus by using a .dialogrc in your root dir.
go to: bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Dialog_customization_with_configuration_file
If you need the dialog source, it is here: ftp://invisible-island.net/dialog
- use the tar.gz version.

1. create your partitions. I suggest you do:
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda(x) for all of them - plus mkswap /dev/sda(x)

2. Edit chapter02.sh to match your partitions and run the script
3. Same with chapter03.sh

4. Copy the files: lfs-Makefile.patch and pkguser.tar.xz to $LFS/sources
Don't change these names. They are hardwired into the lfsa script.

5. copy lfsa to $LFS

6. Create a lfs user as per the book. Don't forget to set up the lfs 
environment too. Do: echo $LFS_TGT and make sure something is
returned.

7. Run lfsa as root.  Edit the config file to suit. If requested, the
sources will be downloaded, the requested LFS book svn'd and the following scripts created in $LFS - chapter05.sh, chapter06-asroot.sh, chapter06-chroot.sh,
chapter06.sh and lastly chapter08.sh. Copy chapter07.sh to $LFS and edit to match your environment. Run the scripts in chapter order. Run chapter05.sh as user lfs; all the others as root.

The scripts have been tested with  LFS version 7.1 and 'Current Development'. You
don't need the patch with 'Current Development'. Older versions may
break - they haven't been tested.

chapter08.sh creates a placeholder to build the kernel.

When the scripts have finished, follow chapter 8 from the book to
install the kernel. Do su kernel to enter the kernel dir. mkproper has already
been run.

The package-user management system uses three main scripts:-

installpkg, listpkg and delpkg

To install a new package, do: installpkg pkg-name. By default the
package user directory is created under /usr/src/core. You can change
it - just edit installpkg in /usr/sbin/. You can also do: 
installpkg pkg-name install-dir to override the default dir.

Additionally, you can also do: installpkg pkg-name install-dir uid 
to specify the user id number. By default the uid starts at 10000 and
increments with each package added. You can override this by specifying the uid. 
This is useful for packages such as apache and avahi which have suggested uids
in the blfs book.

Before you delete a package with delpkg, use listpkg to see which files will go.
delpkg pkg-name will delete all files owned by pkg-name. You have been warned.

To do maintenance on a package do: su pkg-name. So to install the kernel, do 
su kernel and it will take you to /usr/src/core/kernel where the source file is
already untared and mkproper already run. Just add your .config file, make and
install the kernel.

If you decide to run the tests, you may well find that the gcc tests fail. I got
21 failures with libmudflap and this stopped the script running. You'll have to
restart the script with the tests set to no. Do this in the config file edit at
the start of the lfsa script.
